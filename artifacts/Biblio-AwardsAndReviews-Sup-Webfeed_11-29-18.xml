Finally, they prove that, in opposing them, bankers and their apologists have spun intellectual raiment as invisible as the emperor's new clothes. . . . Read this book.

But Anat Admati, a finance professor at Stanford University, and Martin Hellwig, a director at the Max Planck Institute for Research on Collective Goods, have done an admirable job in explaining how capital in the banking system works to absorb shocks, and how too little of it makes banks unstable."&lt;b&gt;--&lt;i&gt;Economist&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;</ReviewText>

      <ReviewText>"&lt;i&gt;The Bankers' New Clothes&lt;/i&gt; is a lucid exposition of the intellectual falsehoods deployed by banks to justify the ways in which they went about growing their business beyond any reasonable assessment of risk in the run-up of the crisis of 2008 and which they continue to peddle today. Admati and Hellwig cut through the debates about whether it was too little or too much regulation that was to blame, whether central banks could and should have acted faster, and the rights and wrongs of securitisation or separating commercial and investment banking, and go to the heart of the matter."&lt;b&gt;--Will Hutton, &lt;i&gt;New Statesman&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;</ReviewText>

      <ReviewText>"The second edition's new component . . .  is Shiller's exploration of how market psychology has responded to the ensuing five years of retrenchment. One chilling conclusion he reaches from his knowledge of past market performance is that the 2005 market may still be correcting and that a return to 2000 levels may be a decade away. He further warns that many investors are still too heavily invested in equities and that proposals to invest Social Security funds in the stock market would subject the retirement system to unacceptable risk.

      <ReviewText>"Balleisen casts a gimlet eye on the passing parade of hucksters and charlatans, peppering a narrative long on theory with juicy asides that build toward a comprehensive catalog of ‘Old Swindles in New Jargon'. . . . Ranging among the disciplines of history, economics, and psychology, Balleisen constructs a sturdy narrative of the many ways in which we have fallen prey to the swindler, and continue to do so, as well as of how American society and its institutions have tried to build protections against the con. But these protections eventually run up against accusations of violating ‘longstanding principles of due process,' since the bigger the con, the more lawyers arrayed behind it."&lt;b&gt;--&lt;i&gt;Kirkus&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;</ReviewText>

In a new book, &lt;i&gt;Fraud: An American History from Barnum to Madoff&lt;/i&gt;, the Duke University professor Edward J. Balleisen argues that fraud has been a central feature of our freewheeling economy from the start, making it hard to tell scams from legitimate businesses and hard to tell aggressive sales tactics from outright deception--especially in innovative industries."&lt;b&gt;--Carina Chocano, &lt;i&gt;New York Times Magazine&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;</ReviewText>

      <ReviewText>"Philippe Desan, in &lt;i&gt;Montaigne: A Life&lt;/i&gt; (Princeton; translated from the French by Steven Rendall and Lisa Neal), his immense new biography . . . insists that our ‘Château d'Yquem' Montaigne, Montaigne the befuddled philosopher and sweet-sharp humanist, is an invention, untrue to the original. Our Montaigne was invented only in the early nineteenth century. The Eyquem family, in their day, made no wine at all. They made their fortune in salted fish--and Desan's project is to give us a salty rather than a sweet Montaigne."&lt;b&gt;--Adam Gopnik, &lt;i&gt;New Yorker&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;</ReviewText>

      <ReviewText>"In his endeavour to provide an account of Montaigne's life, Desan is to be praised. Writing biographies of early modern lives is fraught with complications. Contemporaneous records for all but the most pre-eminent in society are scant; fissures and lacunae are everywhere. . . . Desan’s is a masterly literary biography, the scholarly expertise of its author showing in its acute attention to documentary detail."&lt;b&gt;--Patrick J.

      <ReviewText>"The ‘Essays,' Montaigne informed his readers, were written for a ‘domestic and private’ end and not for ‘either you or my own glory.’ He presented himself ‘in my simple, natural, ordinary fashion, without straining or artifice; for it is myself that I portray.’ Philippe Desan’s &lt;i&gt;Montaigne: A Life&lt;/i&gt; is animated by the purpose of detonating this carefully cultivated image. It is an effort at disenchantment. Montaigne’s informality and transparency, in Mr. Desan’s telling, were rhetorical strategies and triumphs of artifice. Montaigne’s exploration of the private self was not a natural impulse but an adjustment required by the defeat of his considerable political ambitions. . . . [Desan] seeks  to drag the solitary genius back into his social milieu, exposing his conventionality. Montaigne claimed to have portrayed himself ‘naked’ to posterity. Mr. Desan removes the last of his garments."&lt;b&gt;--Jeffrey Collins, &lt;i&gt;Wall Street Journal&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;</ReviewText>

      <ReviewText>"Philippe Desan's biography gives back to us the political Montaigne, a figure long displaced by another. The image of Montaigne immured in his tower--an image he himself began to cultivate before he died--has only grown stronger over the centuries: he seems to represent thought and literature outside history and above politics, access to a universal human condition and a perennial philosophy. He is a powerful symbol, a paragon of subjective contemplation in an era of faction and unrest. But Desan suggests this symbol represents something anachronistic and dangerous. . . . Montaigne’s literary-philosophical innovations grew directly out of failed strategies designed to serve his political ambitions. The true story makes a better and more interesting history."&lt;b&gt;--Robert Minto, &lt;i&gt;Los Angeles Review of Books&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;</ReviewText>

      <ReviewText>"The chapter that's situated in Australia brings all of [the book's] ideas together in most satisfying fashion. Down Under, the land offered little in the way of natural anti-scorbutics, and convicts and colonists suffered greatly from the disease. Its effects, as Lamb neatly shows, exacerbated the sufferings of the convicts, who were provided very little in the way of fresh food; as in his passages about scurvy on board slave ships, I was struck by the realization that scurvy was often one more weapon in the arsenal of the oppressor during an age of colonization. . . . Two-hundred years ago, Australia's penal regime caused scurvy in its prisoners, through poor diet, and then condemned them for stealing greens from the colony's nascent gardens to feed their bodies. In the United States, in 2016, Michigan has still not restored clean water to Flint, after two years; the lead poisoning there may cause all kinds of physical and mental complications for residents. Lamb's book shows just how hard it can be for humans to fix an endemic problem when pride and prejudice get in the way."&lt;b&gt;--Rebecca Onion, &lt;i&gt;Slate&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;</ReviewText>

      <ReviewText>"To the extent that most people are familiar with scurvy today, it's as a condition that, like bubonic plague, seems to belong to the past, or as a mock-serious admonishment to children reluctant to eat their greens. Students of history know it primarily as an ailment associated with the Age of Discovery, during which large numbers of mariners had to endure months away from land for the first time in history. Successive generations of writers perceived the link between lengthy sojourns at sea and increased incidents of scurvy among ships' crews, and tried to make sense of it. As Jonathan Lamb stresses in this thought-provoking study, the irony of the history of scurvy is how often people hit upon the correct remedy—and how often society at large failed to recognize it as such. . . . Lamb's writing style is elegant. . . . The enthusiasm for the subject is infectious (no pun intended)."&lt;b&gt;--Craig Owen Jones, &lt;i&gt;PopMatters&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;</ReviewText>

The book proposes that humans integrate themselves and their activity into a natural ecological niche, striving to control their impact on the natural environment by understanding and engineering their place in it. . . . &lt;i&gt;The New Ecology&lt;/i&gt; is persuasive in its argument that conscientious stewardship is more productive than an attempt to separate humans from the environment completely. . . .

      <ReviewText>"Walter Scheidel’s &lt;i&gt;The Great Leveler&lt;/i&gt; is a smartly argued book. As you may be able to tell from the title, Mr. Scheidel makes the case that throughout history, inequality has led only to terrible things (think pandemics and wars). For anybody who has ever debated issues related to inequality and their broader meaning, this book provides more than just a powerful thought experiment."&lt;b&gt;--Andrew Ross Sorkin, &lt;i&gt;New York Times&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;</ReviewText>

      <ReviewText>"One by one Scheidel dismisses the non-catastrophic alternatives that have been the focus of virtually every peaceful movement for social justice: democracy, the extension of the franchise, education, economic growth, social democracy, trade unionism and the welfare state. Their effects, he demonstrates, have been comparatively trivial and have never compensated for the inexorable march of inequality."&lt;b&gt;--J. C.

      <ReviewText>"As a supplier of momentary relief, the Great Depression seems an unlikely candidate. . . . Yes, it brought widespread suffering and dreadful misery. But it did not bring death to millions, and in that it stands out. If that counts as relief, you can begin to imagine the scale of the woe that comes before and after. [Scheidel] puts the discussion of increased inequality found in the recent work of Thomas Piketty, Anthony Atkinson, Branko Milanovic and others into a broad historical context and examines the circumstances under which it can be reduced."&lt;b&gt;--&lt;i&gt;The Economist&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;</ReviewText>

      <ReviewText>"Tight labor markets shrink income inequality by causing employers to bid up the price of scarce labor, so policymakers fretting about income inequality could give an epidemic disease a try. This might be a bit extreme but if increased equality is the goal, Stanford's Walter Scheidel should be heard. His scholarship encompasses many things (classics, history, human biology) and if current events are insufficiently depressing for you, try his just-published book &lt;i&gt;The Great Leveler: Violence and the History of Inequality from the Stone Age to the Twenty-First Century&lt;/i&gt;.

The book goes a long way toward reviving the idea that the past, rather than being buried and gone, is the last and greatest frontier of human exploration."&lt;b&gt;--&lt;i&gt;New Criterion&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;</ReviewText>

The popular quartet (soon to be quintet) of Indiana Jones films succeeds largely because it follows this formula, but readers who prefer the real-life equivalent should be equally pleased with Eric Cline's book. It’s a compendium of fascinating stories. . . .  That people worldwide have ancestors of whom they can be proud, and whose achievements they can and must work to honor and preserve, is indeed a message for our time. Cline conveys it with a blend of earnestness and good humor, vivid descriptions, and conversational style. His book deserves to be widely read and its call to action heeded."&lt;b&gt;--Valerie H.

The author’s specialty is the Aegean Bronze Age, but he discusses discoveries as diverse as pre-modern human remains in Africa to Incan cities in Peru to the Terracotta Army in Xi’an. It’s particularly fascinating to read how various groups attempt to spin archaeological discoveries to support their own narratives.

But Whitman’s adroit scholarly detective work has proved that in the mid-’30s Nazi jurists and politicians turned again and again to the way the United States had deprived African-Americans of the right to vote and to marry whites.

Indeed, Nazi jurists criticized their American counterparts for their hypocrisy in publicly denying yet locally practicing systematic racism.

He points out that by the late 1870s, US immigration and naturalisation law had become more racist, in particular against Asians."&lt;b&gt;--Charlie Hegarty, &lt;i&gt;Catholic Herald&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;</ReviewText>

      <ReviewText>"Whitman's bracing and well-researched account should remind us that the nativism and racism on the rise in America today are in no way foreign to our traditions. Nor have they belonged mainly to the unwashed and poorly educated. On the contrary, it is only in the middle of the last century that the idea of racial equality began to enter the mainstream, and only in the post-civil rights era that at least some lip service to that ideal became mandatory in polite circles."&lt;b&gt;--Jessica Blatt, &lt;i&gt;Public Books&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;</ReviewText>

      <ReviewText>"Few efforts manage to elucidate with such level of clarity of purpose and rigorous scholarly research the historical threats to our American experiment as James Q. Whitman's &lt;i&gt;Hitler’s American Model&lt;/i&gt;. . . . This is an essential, alarming read for every student of American democracy, and for any person who cares about the fate of humanity in an experiment which has significant roots in a supremacist rot that is poisonous to its branches of government. While it does a superb job with the history, it also propounds the means by which that experiment may yet fail in the future."&lt;b&gt;--Michael Workman, &lt;i&gt;Rain Taxi&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;</ReviewText>

      <ReviewText>"Whitman’s method is both of a legal historian and comparative lawyer and his book offers a clear and well-documented account of the history of Nazi law, by exploring the context of elaboration of the Nuremberg Laws. Also, it is a significant example of how comparative law works in practice--not simply imitating statutes, but by gradual transplants of legal ideas, later adapted and developed by national legislations."&lt;b&gt;--Jair Santos, &lt;i&gt;Politics, Religion &amp; Ideology&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;</ReviewText>

      <ReviewText>"Wide-reaching, stimulating and learned. . . . Scruton has here given us a succinct but properly philosophical account of human nature. It is a timely and useful corrective against the sterile ethical theories which dominate the medical ethics literature. Students and educators alike will find its content stimulating, and its fine prose enjoyable.  Many philosophers take it upon themselves to dismantle our black-and-white notions, and help us see the world in its true shades-of-grey complexity. But few inject into it the colour needed to make it a joy. Scruton is one such philosopher, and thus his work is to be commended now as ever."&lt;b&gt;--Toni C.

      <ReviewText>"Agrawal's marvelous book is one of the most in--depth explorations of the process of co--evolution I have ever read. . . . What sets this book apart is two things: the superior quality of the writing and the range of scientific depth to which each topic is explored. Agrawal could give the recent grandmaster of science writing, Stephen Jay Gould, a proverbial run, and as a consequence, the book is highly accessible to everyone in a wide age range and from a variety of educational backgrounds."&lt;b&gt;--NSTA Recommends&lt;/b&gt;</ReviewText>

      <ReviewText>"Science strongly indicates all living things evolved from a common ancestor to form the complex biosphere we inhabit on earth. Agrawal deftly plucks one strand from this web of life, the monarch butterfly, and elucidates reverberations that resonate from the dawn of time to the present and back and forth among life forms along the way. . . . Monarch life history on a toxic host laden with cardenolides and largely dependent on migrating vast distances to tiny overwintering sites and back again is the backbone of the book. . . . Color illustrations are abundantly informative, the main text font is eminently legible with a useful index, and the well bound paper stock bodes well for the physical longevity of the book."&lt;b&gt;--&lt;i&gt;Science Books &amp; Film&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;</ReviewText>

      <ReviewText>"Why are upscale versions of traditional manufacturing and service jobs considered hip, desirable, and cool? Ocejo, a sociology professor, examines the ‘urban village model' that has revitalized urban areas. He looks at four elements of gentrification--craft breweries, barber shops, whole-animal butcher shops, and cocktail bars. . . . Using his own field experiences and interviews with business owners and workers, the author identifies transformations in the U.S. cultural elite that have led to this new service economy, one that is strikingly male-dominated. He uses Chelsea Market in Manhattan as an example of how the reappearance of businesses formerly considered essential, but not prestigious, in exclusive and expensive form mirrors the gentrification of the neighborhoods that once supported them in their previous incarnations. The book reads well. . . . Sociologists and others with a serious interest in hipster culture will learn much from it."&lt;b&gt;--&lt;i&gt;Publishers Weekly&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;</ReviewText>

Grounded in some inspiring primary research and embedded interviews, Ocejo examines how the renewal and enhancement of some long-known jobs and crafts can impact participants, neighborhoods, and attitudes. This scholarly and compelling study examines the resurgence of craft labor among upscale men's barbers, whole-animal butcher shop workers, cocktail bartenders, and craft distillers in Brooklyn, Manhattan, and upstate New York and in so doing exposes some of the realities, nuances, and consequences of artisanal laborers in the modern age."&lt;b&gt;--&lt;i&gt;Choice&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;</ReviewText>

The authors cite three main reasons for Trump's victory: ‘fractured ranks’ within the Republican Party that impeded party leaders from coalescing behind any candidate; outsized media coverage of Trump that made him appear to be the front-runner even when coverage focused on scandals; and ‘racialized economics,’ in which racial attitudes ‘shaped the way voters understood economic outcomes.’ . . . &lt;b&gt;A cogent, well-documented analysis of the 2016 election&lt;/b&gt;."&lt;b&gt;--&lt;i&gt;Kirkus&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;</ReviewText>

      <ReviewText>"The portion of the world's economy that doesn't fit the old model just keeps getting larger. That has major implications for everything from tax law to economic policy to which cities thrive and which cities fall behind, but in general, the rules that govern the economy haven’t kept up. This is one of the biggest trends in the global economy that isn’t getting enough attention. If you want to understand why this matters, the brilliant new book &lt;i&gt;Capitalism Without Capital&lt;/i&gt; by Jonathan Haskel and Stian Westlake is about a good an explanation as I’ve seen."&lt;b&gt;--Bill Gates&lt;/b&gt;</ReviewText>

      <ReviewText>"The historical view of ‘capital as something tangible persists and limits our thinking,' the authors argue. To be sure, exactly which intangible assets qualify as capital can be debated endlessly. In &lt;i&gt;Capitalism Without Capital&lt;/i&gt;, [they] choose a broad definition and explore its implications. In so doing, they provide insights into some puzzling questions . . . [and] make a good case that we don't know as much as we think because some of our tools for measuring economic performance are out of date."&lt;b&gt;--George Molloan, &lt;i&gt;Wall Street Journal&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;</ReviewText>

They are not trying to make any statement on the EU, but in one chapter of their book they plot tangible and intangible investment against an OECD measure of employment strictness. The results are fascinating. In their own words: 'countries with more restrictive hiring and firing invest more in tangibles and less in intangibles'."&lt;b&gt;--Graeme Leach, &lt;i&gt;CityAM&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;</ReviewText>

      <ReviewText>"Composed of a set of politically independent city-states around the Mediterranean--most notably, Tyre, Arwad, Byblos, and Carthage--Phoenicia is typically thought of as a unified precursor to the Greek civilization that ultimately eclipsed it. In a new book, however, Josephine Quinn, an associate professor of ancient history at the University of Oxford, argues that the entire idea of a proto-nationalist ‘Phoenician’ identity or culture may not have existed at all. Rather, evidence suggests that it is unlikely that Phoenicians saw themselves as a collective that rose above the level of the city or indeed family. As such, Quinn argues that the histories of Phoenicia that invented and sustained this narrative of a Phoenician national identity are themselves worthy of study. . . . Quinn’s &lt;i&gt;In Search of the Phoenicians&lt;/i&gt; will serve as a comprehensive introduction to the literary, artistic, dramatic, and technological cultures of these ancient societies."&lt;b&gt;--&lt;i&gt;The New Criterion&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;</ReviewText>

      <ReviewText>"In this outstanding work Tulis elegantly portrays the increased use of rhetoric by 20th-century presidents, portraying the negative effects of the 'rhetorical Presidency.' Presidents of the 19th century were seldom seen or heard by the public, a comportment intended by the founders who feared the excitation of the masses by demagogic leaders. Theodore Roosevelt changed the practice, and Woodrow Wilson provided the rationale for speaking 'the common meaning of the common voice.' The drawbacks of this behavior include an increasing lack of 'fit' between the office and its occupant, a greater mutability of policy by rhetorical persuasion, the erosion of careful deliberation, and the decay of political discourse. This is an exemplary work of mutually supportive normative argument and empirical investigation. Tulis's quantitative analysis is motivated by concern for the health of the American republic, not by a banal attempt to be 'scientific.' The work is a must for all undergraduate libraries."&lt;b&gt;--S.E. Schier, &lt;i&gt;Choice&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;</ReviewText>

As he documents this process, Serreze doesn’t shy away from the failures of the Arctic research community, including his own.

Years passed, the ice continued to melt, and Serreze came to favor fire. ‘The weight of evidence turned me,’ he observes. ‘And then I turned hard.’ He gives the perennial sea ice until 2030 or so. ‘That the Arctic Ocean will become free of sea ice in late summer and early autumn is a given,’ he writes."&lt;b&gt;--Elizabeth Kolbert, &lt;i&gt;New Yorker&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;</ReviewText>

      <ReviewText>"[Serreze] shares the story of how he entered the field of climate science by accident; why, at first, he thought the climate might be getting colder rather than warmer, based on measurements from complicated Arctic weather systems; how, year after year, he became further convinced about the reality of global warming due to slowly accumulating data; and why he began to participate avidly in a scientific consensus combating climate-change deniers, most of whom have been politically motivated. Ultimately, what Serreze produces is a kind of detective story; the major crime is the human causation of global warming. . . .

      <ReviewText>"The prominent Chinese artist and dissident Ai Weiwei has long used his fame and social media as a megaphone for his activism. It was because of his blogging and Twitter activity criticizing the government that he was detained by the Chinese police for nearly three months and had his passport taken away in 2011. And his Instagram posts of the last few years have brought increasing international attention to the refugee crisis, as has his documentary &lt;i&gt;Human Flow&lt;/i&gt;, released last fall. But now Mr. Ai has returned to a more traditional form of expression: &lt;i&gt;Humanity&lt;/i&gt;, a little blue book . . . that collects excerpts from Mr. Ai’s thoughts and aphorisms."&lt;b&gt;--Robin Pogrebin, &lt;i&gt;New York Times&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;</ReviewText>

The quotes are presented and organized by artist and longtime collaborator Larry Warsh, who also writes the introduction, starting with the question 'What is our human obligation?'

      <ReviewText>"A dispassionate overview of the term and concepts of liberalism—how it emerged, evolved, diversified, and alienated. Rosenblatt (History/Graduate Center, CUNY) has published previous works about liberalism (&lt;i&gt;Liberal Values: Benjamin Constant and the Politics of Religion&lt;/i&gt;, 2008, etc.), and she brings considerable scholarly substance to this work, though most of it forms the infrastructure for the accessible text. . . . There are some true surprises here, too, perhaps most notably the initial liberal opposition to women's rights and a fondness for eugenics in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. The author also notes, surprisingly, that factions within various liberal movements were opposed to government help for the poor—a disincentive, they claimed. &lt;b&gt;Fair, balanced, and chockablock with information and surprise&lt;/b&gt;."&lt;b&gt;--&lt;i&gt;Kirkus&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;</ReviewText>

      <ReviewText>"Rosenblatt has &lt;b&gt;meticulously researched&lt;/b&gt; the word’s history, unearthing forgotten meanings. She moves from liberalism’s roots in 19th century France and Germany to its growing association with the United States in the 20th century. Gradually, an idea that began as moralistic — and warned against the dangers of selfishness — underwent a transformation. After World War II, conservatives associated liberalism with the kind of grand social schemes they believed led to totalitarianism. Liberals retreated to a position that emphasized individual rights but not necessarily generosity toward others. Rosenblatt invites a return to this broader, Wisconsin-style view."&lt;b&gt;--M.J.

      <ReviewText>"[Daniel Rodgers] argues that the comparison of America to a city on a hill that politicians often use, quoting from John Winthrop’s 1630 lay sermon ‘Model of Christian Charity,’ is not true to the sermon’s original sentiment and distorts the historical legacy of the passage. . . . It wasn’t until Cold War–era writers and thinkers revisited the ‘Model’ in search of evidence of America’s universal nature (ignoring the text’s historical context) that it regained popularity. Through a winding, enthralling timeline, Rodgers successfully illuminates the strange history of ‘a text that we think we know so well that we barely know it at all.’"&lt;b&gt;--&lt;i&gt;Publishers Weekly&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;</ReviewText>

Umberger’s unsurpassed skill as a historian and writer, cuts easily through it all revealing depth and dimension. For the reader not intimidated by the bulk of this volume, approaching six pounds, there is much reward and there are too many insights to list.

      <ReviewText>"The detective work in &lt;i&gt;Between Worlds&lt;/i&gt; is so engrossing that one may be forgiven for forgetting that the book is also an exhibition catalogue. It accompanies an extensive retrospective, now at the Smithsonian American Art Museum in Washington, DC, of Bill Traylor’s paintings and drawings. Traylor, who died in 1949, is considered one of the most important 'folk' or 'self-taught' American artists. But this project demonstrates in magisterial manner how his work exceeds these limiting categories. . . . Umberger is refreshingly blunt about the art world’s racial politics, the persistence and consequences of gatekeeping, and the way categories like 'folk art' marginalize the makers of those pieces. She offers deep research into the artist’s like and work as a welcome remedy."&lt;b&gt;--Siddhartha Mitter, &lt;i&gt;Bookforum&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;</ReviewText>

Samuel Johnson, he sums up, was 'skeptical, deeply troubled in mind, mad at times, neurotic nearly always, radically doubtful of himself and of the social values he at the same time so stoutly defended.' To that 'existential Johnson,' Kernan adds an image of Johnson as a model of success in the emergent print culture.

Second, Jones criticizes those (often historians) who think of a 'cultural fixity', in which an unchanging culture dominates every other aspect of life. . . .

The mathematics is by no means trivial, and quickly becomes fiendish if the merchant ship takes evasive action. This is just one of the colorful problems in Paul Nahin's fascinating history of the mathematics of pursuit, in which he guides us masterfully through the maths itself--think lions and Christians, submarines and torpedoes, and the curvaceous flight of fighter aircraft."&lt;b&gt;--&lt;i&gt;New Scientist&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;</ReviewText>

In this way, for all of its incredible, information-sharing connectivity, the Web can be isolating, especially when groups begin to 'echo chamber' and talk only to themselves...To my mind, Sunstein has always been lucid and valuable on this topic. But despite the Web's culture-changing successes--wiring up the economy, influencing presidential campaigns--many Web advocates and bloggers still act as though they're threatened.  When they're not acting triumphalist, that is.  Even the lightest guidelines, in short, will be resented, particularly when our confusion of free markets with free speech has proved so profitable."&lt;b&gt;--Jerome Weeks, &lt;i&gt;San Francisco Chronicle&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;</ReviewText>

Teles charts the success of the conservative legal establishment over the past several decades.  Digging past liberal clichés about an all-powerful Federalist Society tree fort, Teles charts a complicated countermobilization that took place in legal academia and conservative public-interest law, against law schools and a government in thrall with liberal ideas.

      <ReviewText>"Lawyers fill an important role in American democracy, as the conduit for transmitting social mores from the nation's elite to the people, and vice versa. How they do this is something sociologists have spent relatively little time researching, but Steven M. Teles has taken a step to remedy this by producing an engaging, insightful, and remarkably objective analysis of how the climate of legal ideas actually changes. His book is neither history nor polemic, but a scholarly study of how an ideological minority organized despite overwhelming hostility, knot an effective (if still minority) force against the prevailing orthodoxy. . . .

[In] The Warhol Economy the social scientist Elizabeth Currid argues that this fixation is misdirected, and that it has led us to neglect the city's most vital and distinctive economic sector: the culture industry, which, in Currid's definition, includes everything from fashion, art, and music to night clubs. In other words, it's SoHo and Chelsea, not Wall Street, that the politicians should really be thinking about. Of course, everyone knows that art and culture help make New York a great place to live. But Currid goes much further, showing that the culture industry creates tremendous economic value in its own right."&lt;b&gt;--James Surowiecki, &lt;i&gt;The New Yorker&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;</ReviewText>

If you want to be world capital of culture, it may be more important to have low rents for big spaces and somewhere to dance....The importance of her work is that she's saying the obvious to policy wonks and city planners, hanging her arguments on an impressive framework of proper statistics."&lt;b&gt;--Michael Pye, &lt;i&gt;Scotsman&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;</ReviewText>

Others have discussed the New York City arts scene from the standpoint of economic geography, but none better than Currid. Her understanding of how the industry functions and her insightful analysis of its economics provides the basis for her discussion of what urban policy makers should do to foster growth of this essential element in the economy of the creative or knowledge city."&lt;b&gt;--P.K.

      <ReviewText>"Nobody has done more to damage relations between the joyous commercial festival that is Christmas and the economics profession than Joel Waldfogel. Long-term readers of this column will be well aware of Professor Waldfogel's research paper, 'The Deadweight Loss of Christmas'. Ever since it was published in 1993 it has been taken out by economic journalists and displayed like last year's decorations. Waldfogel--a witty writer himself--has evidently decided that if everyone is going to discuss the idea, he may as well get in on the act, so has published Scroogenomics, a book that--dare I say it--looks like it would make a terrific stocking-filler."&lt;b&gt;--Tim Harford, &lt;i&gt;Financial Times&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;</ReviewText>

As a good anthropologist, he wants to know not just what the politicians and the media are saying about Islam in France, but what is actually happening on the ground. . . . Mr. Bowen thinks that Muslim values and French secularism could be compatible. But accommodation requires give-and-take on both sides. . . . Can Islam be French? After reading this book, one is inclined to say, 'Yes, but not yet.'"&lt;b&gt;--&lt;i&gt;Economist&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;</ReviewText>

      <ReviewText>"[Bowen] makes an important contribution to both the anthropology of France and the anthropology of Islam in the West through his detailed discussion of different Islamic schools of religious interpretation and traditions of jurisprudence. By examining the myriad debates that define a global Islamic space, Bowen challenges stereotypes about the monolithic religion that prevail in the media and across the political spectrum. . . . Bowen does a remarkable job of sifting through and making sense of a vast array of approaches to Islamic norms and of differentiating meaningfully among different Islamic schools."&lt;b&gt;--Susan Terrio, &lt;i&gt;Anthropological Quarterly&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;</ReviewText>

      <ReviewText>"Distinguished civil rights historian and sociologist Sugrue (&lt;i&gt;Sweet Land of Liberty&lt;/i&gt;) follows Barack Obama's intellectual journey and political education from his student years in the late 1970s through his first years as president, offering an insightful and fresh glimpse of Obama through three lenses--as intellectual, politician, and policy maker--and with three essays. While David Remnick's comprehensive &lt;i&gt;The Bridge&lt;/i&gt; bears thematic similarities, Sugrue offers a pithy and readable survey of some of the same terrain--the path that 'rooted the rootless Hawaiian in the history of the Southern freedom struggle' and the formation of his politics that favored 'reconciliation over confrontation.' Sugrue addresses Obama's Chicago years and the evolution of his thinking on class. And the final essay assesses Obama as candidate and president. Particularly noteworthy is Sugrue's attention to Obama's post-Jeremiah Wright controversy speech in 2008 ('the most learned disquisition on race from a major political figure ever') and a splendid illumination of the roles played by books (particularly the work of William Julius Wilson), by mentors (political and clerical), and by family (especially Michelle Obama's) in Obama's ascent."&lt;b&gt;--&lt;i&gt;Publishers Weekly&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;</ReviewText>

He situates Barack Obama's personal racial and political odyssey in a richly textured history of race, class, and politics in the late twentieth century, and in Sugrue's deft and elegant prose, Obama's political biography becomes a lens through which American politics and race relations come into clearer view. . . . [T]he persistence of racial inequality in an apparently "post-racial" world--that is perhaps the most profound challenge facing American politics and society, and Sugrue's book is an essential guide to those who seek to answer that challenge."&lt;b&gt;--Robert C.

More engrossingly, Hahn employs mathematics to explore how architects have conceived of buildings through the ages. In the case of Milan's cathedral, Hahn's discussion is especially rich because his maths plays out against a backdrop of detailed historical documentation, including the testimony of the German [master builder]."&lt;b&gt;--Jonathon Keats, &lt;i&gt;New Scientist&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;</ReviewText>

Hahn considers numerous buildings such as the Parthenon, the Hagia Sophia, the US Capitol, and the Sydney Opera House, providing a tour through the history of architecture with care and appropriate detail. . . . The author balances the richness of the buildings with the generous development of the mathematical topics, including polygonal geometry, trigonometry, symmetry, conic sections, perspective, and the calculus--all leavened with the problems of transferring loads and stable structures. . . . Hahn has served up a beautiful mix of mathematics, architecture, and history, and he has made it accessible to most readers.

      <ReviewText>"The challenge of books such as these is that, in the wrong hands, the contents can come across as banal generalities and just so much hokum.

It's a very systematic book about being organized and critical in one's thinking, written by individuals whose work demands that they are organized and critical in their thinking. Yet it isn't at all imposing; in fact, the discussion is often down-to-earth, and the fact that the book is structured like a playbook readers can easily apply certainly has its merits.

Many of the images collected here are lesser-known or obscure, and the more recognizable ones he interprets in surprising ways. . . .

      <ReviewText>"Physically &lt;i&gt;Weiwei-isms&lt;/i&gt; is a black, small hardbound book, fitting nicely into a jacket pocket and meant to be carried around, perused at chance moments and ruminated on. It knowingly bears a resemblance to the little red books that were given out by Chairman Mao in order to popularize his philosophies to his subjects. Yet, brainwashing is not the dastardly attempt of the author this time; it is more akin to brain-widening. Take a look for yourself. I feel safe in saying that some statement, one of his turns of phrase, will hit you like a punch in the gut, likely leaving an emotional bruise that will take great time and thought to recover from."&lt;b&gt;--Luke Goldstein, &lt;i&gt;Blogcritics&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;</ReviewText>

Unlike &lt;i&gt;The Little Red Book&lt;/i&gt;, carrying &lt;i&gt;Weiwei-isms&lt;/i&gt; isn't compulsory, but you'll find yourself compelled to read it again and again and fit it into your head and heart, if not your pocket."&lt;b&gt;--Bob Duggan, &lt;i&gt;Big Think&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;</ReviewText>

      <ReviewText>"This little book collects Ai's aphorisms, or 'Weiwei-isms,' distilled thoughts culled from Ai's writings, interviews, and Twitter posts on freedom of expression, human rights, art and activism, power and the government, and moral choices. . . . As brilliant and serious as Ai is, he is also companionable and uplifting."&lt;b&gt;--&lt;i&gt;Booklist&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;</ReviewText>

      <ReviewText>"Although this book, a collection of quotes from Chinese artist Ai Weiwei, is only four by five inches in dimension, it contains powerful and dangerous ideas. Powerful for general readers: 'Creativity is part of human nature. It can only be untaught.' And dangerous to China's leaders: 'The people who control culture in China have no culture.' Chinese authorities have beaten and jailed Ai, destroyed his studio, and threatened his loved ones because he won't stop denouncing government oppression. Buy this book to keep his brave words alive, since, as he points out, 'The government computer has one button: delete.'"&lt;b&gt;--R.C. Baker, &lt;i&gt;Village Voice&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;</ReviewText>

      <ReviewText>"Freeman frees the material from its context, selecting excerpts whose content is thought provoking on its own terms, and which demonstrate Cicero's outlook as a thinker in general. Freeman's book is an entry-point, an introduction; while it is simply too short . . . to provide much traction for students in a typical college course, I certainly hope it will be successful in introducing Cicero to a wider audience."&lt;b&gt;--Joanna Kenty, &lt;i&gt;Bryn Mawr Classical Review&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;</ReviewText>
